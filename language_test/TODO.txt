# TODO

I want to at some point switch this to its own repository and do proper branching/committing

* Frequency of commits is probably excessive, but I've bluescreened a few times so I'm paranoid (think it's fixed)
* I should make a branch with the change I'm adding, only commit when the code's stable and there's significant changes
* Use git stash instead of just committing the code

It's a pet project who cares, but I'm trying to reinforce good habits.
Just not in this commit specifically.
